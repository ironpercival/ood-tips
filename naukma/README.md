# OOAD at NaUKMA

OOAD is a required course in software engineering bachelor major at the faculty of informatics at the [National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy](https://www.ukma.edu.ua/eng/). It has been taught in 'offline' mode for several years, but in 2018 the course finally got a more tangible shape with GitHub presence of a companion repository and students assignments. *It would be not possible without a very generous GitHub educational policy with unlimited private repos for free - huge appreciation and many thanks for that!*

Each year's course run got a dedicated org on GitHub. Summary pages listed below provide general idea about how it's organized and maintained:
