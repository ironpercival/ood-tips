OOAD is a required course in software engineering bachelor major at the faculty of informatics of the [National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy](https://www.ukma.edu.ua/eng/). It has been taught purely offline for several years, then in 2018 we started adding modern touches to it: use GitHub to distribute coding assignments, host student submissions, automate grading etc. *It would be not possible without a very generous GitHub educational policy with unlimited private repos for free &mdash; many thanks for that! (Yes, soon after that GitHub even more generously changed their offerings and turned free private repos for everyone. Yet way back in 2018 that was not available and special offering for education really changed the game for us.)*
